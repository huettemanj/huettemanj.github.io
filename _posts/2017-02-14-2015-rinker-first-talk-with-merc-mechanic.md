## So you wondered what a mechanic would ask? ##

Last night I had the opportunity of talking with a seasoned CERTIFIED MERC MECHANIC.  There are a lot of hacks out there folks, talk to a person that knows what they are doing.  I just don't trust that youtube is going to be enough to teach me how to do stuff right every time.  

You bought new?  Wow...  I don't know if he knows I am a cheap bastard or if he just was thinking I crap $20s.  I explained I always buy broken crap, other peoples garbage.  I want my own boat I can trust for a little bit.  

It didn't take long (after the normal banter) for him to ask what engine I had and what outdrive setup.  He says "Send me the serial number. I can look up all the service bulletins and stuff on the motor."  He explained about service bulletins and recalls etc.  This will help, because I will expect they all be fixed before I take ownership on April 1 in a few weeks!!!!  I know I am a tool, but I believe in things being right when I get them.  

I know after the guy sees the boat I will lose all credibility as a fisherman and be relegated to a drunken party hound trying to recapture the youth I wasted.

After some more banter, I begged him to help... I just spent a metric crap ton of money. I wanted to know how to winterize this boat again.  Why?  I live in Michigan and I want to use the boat in Early April...  How bad would that suck to have a new boat and end up cracking the block in the first week of use.  In the future, I will take it to this guys shop to be worked on, why?  I care that people know what they are doing.  The certified mechanics are trained (not to say that the others aren't smart or good.)  The mechanics that are certified got to go to school at the factory and are at least instructed how to do things right.  They care about their craft, and the shops they work at do too.  It is one thing to have the sign out front, it is a whole differnt thing to pay and train your mechanics.  To pay them to go get trained, and to pay for the food/hotel etc.  Don't take this lightly folks, it does matter, if nothing else than for the general good of the industry.  I suggest you talk to your mechanic, find out what the shop he/she works at does.  

Oh... wait until you have a warrenty issue...  

It was a good conversation.  He said the first toy he would put on the boat was a 
[Merc Monitor](https://www.mercurymarine.com/en/us/gauges-and-controls/gauges-displays/mercmonitor/) system.  Okay...  Not the first toy, but he said use the motor for a little while and as it gets older put the monitor on.  "I don't even need to hook the computer up to it to figure out what is going on in most cases."  The Jerk had to go and mention the safety equipment I would need..   I said I have all the life vests I need.  Go and ruin a fun conversation with Safety and knowing that I was going to be dumping a crap ton more money into the boat when it comes to insurance and all that other crap!  

As a computer guy, it seems like the damn boat is just like a printer.  Give the printer away, you will make the money on the ink/toner.  I have heard the hole in the water one too...  They should give the boats away and make the money on all the accessories...   Wait, they make money on both...  Why change...
