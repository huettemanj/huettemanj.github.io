## Radio Research ##

The question I keep getting asked is:  "Why do you want to put a VHF Ship To Shore Radio on a sport boat?"  The answer I give is because my family is going to be on this boat with me.  It turns out that the Coast Guard requires all marine radios to include a distress beacon now.   When linked with a GPS it announces to all boats in the area (that are capable) that you are in distress and where you are located.   WHAT A GREAT IDEA!!!   I know I sure appreciate the idea that my family may be save 1 minute earlier.   Especially if one of us is in real distress.   Cheap insurance!   Like all insurance we buy it so we will never need to use it.

So like all good things in the world, it comes at a price.  THE GOVERNMENT CAN NOW TRACK YOU EVEN BETTER.  Yes it is true, better than the chips placed in our heads at birth :-)  They will be able to find us when we hit the distress button.  Do not fear, you have to register an MMSI number in your radio, it is a property of the radio and can't be changed without the manufacturer getting involved. So do it right!.
 
It is "Free" to register the numbers with SEA TOW and BOAT US...
